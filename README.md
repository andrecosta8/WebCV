# Web CV 

## About

This project was done in a code challenge request. Is a Web based CV of myself.
To do it I used React with Typescript and SCSS. First time doing a project from strach with this stack. 
The project has a Homepage, About me page, Education page, Experience page and a contact page. Also has a dark mode and is responsive to use in mobile phones. A fake backend (JSON-server) is serving data to use in the components (simulating what really happens in bigger scale application).
